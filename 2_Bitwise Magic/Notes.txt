XOR Operator:
The XOR (exclusive OR) operator is a bitwise operator that compares each bit of two operands. The result is 1 if the bits differ, and 0 if they are the same. Here’s a truth table for the XOR operator:

A	B	  A ^ B
0	0	  0
0	1	  1
1	0	  1
1	1	  0
Properties for XOR:
A ^ A = 0 (any number XORed with itself is 0)
A ^ 0 = A (XORing with 0 leaves the number unchanged)
A ^ B = B ^ A (order doesn’t matter)
(A ^ B) ^ C = A ^ (B ^ C) (grouping doesn’t matter)
(A ^ B) ^ B = A (XORing twice cancels out)
